Hello, and welcome to my blog! As of day one, I'd like for this blog to be a collection of how-to's, code walkthroughs, explanations, and maybe a catch-all for yet-to-be-realized ideas. But that could absolutely change. Stay tuned to find out what happens - your guess is as good as mine.

To start, I'm going to share with you why I started coding and what my experience has been so far.


*(expositional backstory which you are allowed to skip):*

I graduated from college in 2013 and was fortunate enough to have secured a job in my chosen industry. Huzzah! Only to realize a year later that my company wasn't the right fit and maybe my industry wasn't the right fit. Not-so-huzzah! So I bounced around, which grown up adults (and also the internet) tells me is okay - it's normal. Not a lot of people graduate from college and immediately know who they are and what they want to do for the forseeable future, let alone the rest of their lives. I can't commit to a favorite pizza topping, so you can imagine my relief.

So, a diamond essentials certification and three short-lived careers later, I was back at the drawing board, trying to pin down exactly what I can do with the skills I have that I would enjoy doing, repeatedly. I knew I liked puzzles. I can sit for hours doing a crossword, untangling necklaces, looking for waldo, fixing a bike chain, or assembling IKEA furniture. If something is broken, my first instinct is always to understand the problem, take it apart, and fix it. My search history went from pictures of puppies to quite the colorful spectrum of career options: "careers for people who like solving puzzles," "careers for investigative realists," "careers for problem-solvers," "careers that will let me play with puppies and solve crimes." Since Mystery Inc. didn't seem like a viable option, I was fairly distressed. Nothing seemed like the right fit.


*(actual story about coding):*

Right around this time, a close friend of mine took a leap of faith and shipped off to CA for a three month intensive dev bootcamp. She had been studying coding independently for a few months, and realized that she wanted to actively pursue software development as a career. I had no idea what that meant, but I was curious. A quick search introduced me to [codecademy](http://codecademy.com) and the introductory courses on [learn](http://learn.co). I thought I'd take a lesson or two, just to understand the basics. Within a few weeks, I found myself fixating on labs that stumped me, and I was almost always itching to return to my coding. When I finished the Intro to Ruby Development on learn.co, I knew I had to apply to Learn Verified because I missed solving all those puzzles. I was hooked.

Coding to me is analytical and creative problem solving. It allows me to build, break, fix, and rebuild, and has introduced me to a friendly community that shares this passion. It is also incredibly dynamic and multi-disciplinary, and provides the foundation from which I can explore any of my interests. Maybe I'll create a dynamic, interactive, crime solver that involves a puppy (but is also somehow not Scooby Doo?), or I'll build a sheet music database, or a way to find the nearest stained glass supplier in a 10 mile radius. I could even seek out the tastiest local slice based on my fluctuating pizza preference. Regardless of what I create, I know I'll enjoy how I go about creating it, and am excited to continue learning (breaking, fixing, building, solving).
