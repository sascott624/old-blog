I recently blogged about that feeling when, as a student, you read a lesson and instantly recognize that it all went over your head. That feeling has an extensive family tree, but one of its more frustrating - and ultimately useful - relatives, is the Very Difficult Lab. We've all been there. Maybe the lab seems simple at first. Maybe it's rough right from the get go. Regardless, you know it's going to be a doozy. My process usually looks like this:

#Step 1: Examine

What is this lab asking me to do? What do I have down pat? What do I need a refresher on? Let's dive in and see how far we can swim.

#Step 2: Re-Assess

Yep, definitely need to regroup. Let's flip through my notes / labs / stackoverflow for a memory jog.

#Step 3: Progress

I probably have another test or two passing! Celebrate! 

#Step 4: Repeat Steps 1-3

#And Again...

#And Again...............


After a few days of tinkering, tailoring, soldiering, spying, prying, debugging, console.logging, and re-re-re-coding, I finally make it. My head is probably aching, my eyes are tired, I've probably stayed up too late because I just have to solve this problem, but I've done it. That feeling of accomplishment is exactly why I love coding. I'm constantly tested and pushed, but if I dig in my heels and put in that extra work, the payoff is so gratifying. More importantly, these are the times when I really feel like I solidify my understanding of a concept. 

Yes, it's great when you can look at a lab and say "I've got this", breeze through, submit, and you're done. Next. But I've found that when I emerge victorious from a lab that has taken me days to push through, I feel a much deeper level of understanding than I do with the code that comes easier to me. The only way to dig yourself out of a seemingly impossible black hole lab, is to tinker with it. Look under the hood and see what gears are turning where, how, and why. Ask questions. Keep pushing. Nag yourself. Nag the internet. Don't stop until you "get it", point blank. Because if you soldier through and submit the Very Difficult Lab knowing what makes it tick, knowing your code inside and out, knowing the key concepts - that feeling is absolutely worth it. And you'll probably find yourself eagerly awaiting the next challenge.
