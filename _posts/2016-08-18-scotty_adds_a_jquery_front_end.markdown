Coding and my mild obsessive nature play very well together. This is something I've known from the get-go, from remembering to close my list tags, to defining ruby case statements, to navigating the difference between each and map. I've always enjoyed logical organization (the sole exception being my kitchen's notorious "junk drawer", and realistically, even that is organized in a sense). So, it should come as no surprise that when I started learning about jQuery selectors, I got very excited.

In learning HTML and CSS, I understood the difference between a class and an id, and how they could be utilized to change that specific header's font, or a paragraph's color and background color, or even hiding divs alltogether. But when I started learning about jQuery selectors, it felt more dynamic. More "real world". Adding event listeners to handle clicks or form submissions and appending divs (or replacing html entirely) - not only was I seeing the organization of the page better, but the entire work flow felt tangible and structured. While ajax get / post requests were a nightmare at first, with the help of Postman and a handful of patient Learn instructors, I finally got the hang of posting and retrieving information from an API. I felt like I really had it down pat. And then..... I started the TicTacToe project.

The Rails TicTacToe project was equal parts frustrating and rewarding. I went into the project thinking I knew this topic cold, only to realize that I still had work to do. That ended up being one of the best things to happen to me, because it forced me to really pry into the code and learn why it was breaking, why it wasn't doing what I thought it would, and how to fix it. It took me a couple of days and careful debugging of almost every line of code, but I made it through. 

So, when it came time to add a jQuery front end to my previous rails app, I was tentatively excited. I felt more prepared for this assessment than arguably for any other, because I had spent so much time and energy knee-deep in my TicTacToe project. Plus, it gave me an opportunity to better organize my app! I really enjoyed adding my own event listeners and JS functions, and querying my own database for the information to render in the appropriately selected and logically organized html elements.
