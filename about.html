<p>One spring, I found an old Masterlock. I knew that the three digit code needed to unlock it was a memorable pattern, but the exact numbers escaped me. When I mentioned this conundrum to a friend, she encouraged me to throw it away and buy a new one. Simple. Instead, I looked up tips and tricks to recover lost Masterlock combinations, and, three hours and a handful of algorithms later, I cracked it.<br>

I started programming because I enjoy solving puzzles. I crave a challenge. Most importantly, though, I love learning. In 2016, I enrolled in the Flatiron School's Learn Verified program, through which I learned HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and AngularJS. This coursework not only gave me an outlet to exercise this creative and analytical reasoning, but also introduced me to a community that thrives on these shared passions. My experience in software development has been incredibly gratifying thus far, and I am looking forward to continuing to solve puzzles, challenge myself, and learn from others in the industry.<br>

I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow as a developer, so please feel free to contact me to talk tech, code, or lost Masterlock combinations!<br><br>
